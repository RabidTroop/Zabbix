# Zabbix

This repository is built to track my ongoing efforts with Zabbix templating. This will hold a majority of templates that were unavailable online and were built for specific devices.

Please note that there may be excluded items or triggers based on what is needed or thought of. All Major templates will require a linked template titled T-GEN-IMP-IP4-C-1-001. This template is a ping template that is attached for easy maintenance.

Any questions, comments, or concerns can be directed to romanethan@hotmail.com.
